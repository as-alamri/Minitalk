# Testing

To test the program you just need to launch the "server" and the "client" in different shell tabs with the following:

$ ./server

This will show your PID to make the client work and will stay waiting to receive a message from the "client"

$ ./client "PID" "Your message string"

By launching it, this will show "Your message string" on the server window.
